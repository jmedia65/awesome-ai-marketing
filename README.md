## Prompts & Frameworks (Start Here)

**Philosophy:** Before paying for tools, try these prompts with ChatGPT/Claude. Many "AI marketing tools" are just wrappers around prompts like these.

### Essential Prompt Resources

- [Anthropic's Prompt Library](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/resources/prompt-library/library) - High-quality optimized prompts from the Claude team for a variety of business and personal tasks.
- [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) - In this repository (139k+ GitHub stars), you will find a wide variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Hugging Face Chat, Llama, Mistral and other AI chat models.
- [OpenAI's Prompting Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompting) - Prompting is the process of providing input to a model. The quality of your output often depends on how well you're able to prompt the model. Learn strategies, techniques, and tools to construct prompts (with code examples).
- [Semrush AI Prompt Library for Content Marketers](https://www.semrush.com/content-hub/ai-prompt-library/) - 600+ tested prompts organized by category (content ideation, SEO, audience research) with placeholder fields for immediate use
- [HubSpot AI Prompt Libraries](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-prompt-library) - A curated collection of AI prompts designed to unlock unconventional marketing strategies
- [AI Prompt Engineering for Digital Marketers](https://maxbraglia.substack.com/p/the-complete-prompt-engineering-toolkit) - A practical guide to getting better results from AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

### When to Use Prompts vs Tools

**Use raw prompts when:**

- You run this task <10 times per month
- You're comfortable with ChatGPT/Claude interface
- Budget is tight

**Use specialized tools when:**

- You run this task daily
- You need team collaboration features
- The tool adds genuine features beyond prompting (data integrations, workflow automation, etc.)

**Example:** Don't pay for a "social media post generator" that's just ChatGPT with a prompt. DO pay for Buffer if you need scheduling, team approval workflows, and analytics.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with prompts. Only upgrade to paid tools when you've proven the workflow is valuable and the tool adds real features beyond better UI.

## Email Marketing

Most email platforms remain fundamentally traditional tools—list management, templates, automation workflows—with AI features layered on top. The AI additions (send-time optimization, subject line generation, predictive analytics) genuinely save time but rarely transform outcomes. Focus on choosing a platform that fits your business model first, then leverage whatever AI features come included.

- **[Klaviyo](https://klaviyo.com)** - The ecommerce email standard, especially for Shopify. Predictive analytics forecast customer lifetime value and churn risk; Segments AI builds complex audiences from plain-language prompts. Premium pricing but deep integration with shopping platforms justifies it for serious stores.
- **[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/solutions/ai-tools/)** - Still the name everyone knows. Send Time Optimization analyzes historical patterns; AI generates on-brand emails with pre-built flows. Good all-rounder but increasingly expensive as you scale—many outgrow it.
- **[ActiveCampaign](https://activecampaign.com)** - Automation powerhouse with Predictive Sending that analyzes individual contact behavior for optimal timing per recipient. 93.4% deliverability rate. Steeper learning curve but rewards the investment.
- **[Kit](https://kit.com)** (formerly ConvertKit) - Creator-focused platform for newsletters, courses, and digital products. AI writing assistant for emails and landing pages; integrates with external AI tools. The go-to for solo creators and small teams who want simplicity.
- **[Omnisend](https://omnisend.com)** - Ecommerce-specific with predictive product recommendations, abandoned cart automation, and cross-channel SMS from one dashboard. Strong Shopify/WooCommerce alternative to Klaviyo at lower price points.
- **[Brevo](https://brevo.com)** - Budget-friendly option with "Aura" AI assistant for send-time optimization, subject lines, and auto-segmentation. Generous free tier makes it ideal for startups and small businesses testing email marketing.
- **[MailerLite](https://mailerlite.com)** - Clean, affordable platform with AI writing assistant and smart sending. Notably supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for integrating external AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT into campaign workflows—unusual for this price tier.
- **[Lavender.ai](https://lavender.ai)** - Sales email coach, not a sending platform. Scores your draft and shows exactly why it might fail before you hit send. Integrates with Gmail/Outlook. For SDRs and sales teams writing cold outreach.
- **[Instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai)** - Cold email infrastructure for outbound at scale. AI personalization that doesn't sound templated, plus deliverability tools to avoid spam folders. For agencies and sales teams doing volume prospecting.

## How to Use This List

### Before You Buy Anything

Most companies buy AI tools backwards—see a demo, get excited, swipe the card, then wonder why it's not moving the needle.

![Should You Buy This AI Tool?](assets/buy_the_ai_tool.png)

**The decision tree:**

1. **Can you name the specific problem?** Not "we need better efficiency." What exactly is broken? If you can't articulate it clearly, don't buy yet.

2. **Can you quantify the cost?** How much is this problem costing you in time, money, or opportunity? No number = no business case.

3. **Does this tool solve THAT problem?** Not "could it maybe help with..." If it doesn't directly address your quantified problem, keep looking.

Only when you hit three yeses do you run a small pilot.

### The Verification Paradox

Every AI tool hallucinates. The question isn't whether—it's whether you can catch it.

The safer tasks are ones where verification is easy: drafting social posts, brainstorming headlines, summarizing content you've already read. The dangerous tasks are ones where checking the output requires the same expertise as doing it yourself—or where you won't know it's wrong until damage is done.

Before adopting any tool on this list, ask: _How hard is it to verify this output?_ If you can't check it, you can't use it safely.

### General Guidelines

- **Start with prompts before buying tools.** A well-crafted prompt to Claude or ChatGPT often eliminates the need for specialized software.
- **Build systems, not one-offs.** Single AI experiments rarely create value. Repeatable workflows do.
