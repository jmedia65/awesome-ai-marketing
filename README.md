## Prompts & Frameworks (Start Here)

**Philosophy:** Before paying for tools, try these prompts with ChatGPT/Claude. Many "AI marketing tools" are just wrappers around prompts like these.

### Essential Prompt Resources

- [Anthropic's Prompt Library](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/prompt-library/library) - High-quality prompts from the Claude team

- [HubSpot AI Prompt Libraries](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-prompt-library) - Two complementary libraries: MATG prompts for creative strategies, and 100 Loop Marketing prompts aligned to Express-Tailor-Expand framework

### When to Use Prompts vs Tools

**Use raw prompts when:**

- You run this task <10 times per month
- You're comfortable with ChatGPT/Claude interface
- Budget is tight

**Use specialized tools when:**

- You run this task daily
- You need team collaboration features
- The tool adds genuine features beyond prompting (data integrations, workflow automation, etc.)

**Example:** Don't pay for a "social media post generator" that's just ChatGPT with a prompt. DO pay for Buffer if you need scheduling, team approval workflows, and analytics.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with prompts. Only upgrade to paid tools when you've proven the workflow is valuable and the tool adds real features beyond better UI.

## How to Use This List

### Understanding the Zones

**🟢 Green Zone Tools** - Use freely, output is easy to verify  
Examples: Content drafts, social media posts, email subject lines

**🟡 Yellow Zone Tools** - Use with guardrails, verification takes real work  
Examples: SEO content, ad copy, data analysis

**🔴 Red Zone Tools** - Dangerous without expertise, proceed with caution  
Examples: Customer service chatbots, automated responses to complaints

Read more about the zone framework in [this article](https://maxbraglia.substack.com/p/the-ai-hallucination-debate-is-missing).

### General Guidelines

1. **Start with prompts** before buying tools
2. **Verify everything** - AI is a draft generator, not a finished product
3. **Build systems** - One-off AI use rarely creates value. Repeatable workflows do.
4. **Match tools to zones** - Don't use AI for tasks you can't verify

---

## Notable Gaps

Marketing functions where good AI tools are still lacking or unreliable:

- **Influencer marketing** - Most tools offer basic discovery but lack sophisticated AI matching or ROI prediction that actually works
- **Podcast marketing** - Beyond basic transcription and clip generation, few tools handle podcast-specific distribution and growth
- **B2B account-based marketing** - AI tools struggle with complex multi-stakeholder attribution
- **Local SEO** - AI tools for managing multi-location businesses remain primitive
- **Brand voice consistency** - Despite marketing claims, most tools still produce inconsistent output requiring significant human editing

---

## Emerging Tools to Watch

Newer tools showing promise but needing more validation:

- **[Peec AI](https://peec.ai)** - Tracks AI visibility metrics (position, sentiment, visibility) across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity with competitive benchmarking—still maturing but addresses growing need. _~€89-199/month._

- Tools with terrible UX that make AI harder to use

Quality over quantity. Always.
