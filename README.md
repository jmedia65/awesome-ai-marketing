## Prompts & Frameworks (Start Here)

**Philosophy:** Before paying for tools, try these prompts with ChatGPT/Claude. Many "AI marketing tools" are just wrappers around prompts like these.

### Essential Prompt Resources

- [Anthropic's Prompt Library](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/resources/prompt-library/library) - High-quality optimized prompts from the Claude team for a variety of business and personal tasks.
- [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) - In this repository (139k+ GitHub stars), you will find a wide variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Hugging Face Chat, Llama, Mistral and other AI chat models.
- [OpenAI's Prompting Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompting) - Prompting is the process of providing input to a model. The quality of your output often depends on how well you're able to prompt the model. Learn strategies, techniques, and tools to construct prompts (with code examples).
- [Semrush AI Prompt Library for Content Marketers](https://www.semrush.com/content-hub/ai-prompt-library/) - 600+ tested prompts organized by category (content ideation, SEO, audience research) with placeholder fields for immediate use
- [HubSpot AI Prompt Libraries](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-prompt-library) - A curated collection of AI prompts designed to unlock unconventional marketing strategies
- [AI Prompt Engineering for Digital Marketers](https://maxbraglia.substack.com/p/the-complete-prompt-engineering-toolkit) - A practical guide to getting better results from AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

### When to Use Prompts vs Tools

**Use raw prompts when:**

- You run this task <10 times per month
- You're comfortable with ChatGPT/Claude interface
- Budget is tight

**Use specialized tools when:**

- You run this task daily
- You need team collaboration features
- The tool adds genuine features beyond prompting (data integrations, workflow automation, etc.)

**Example:** Don't pay for a "social media post generator" that's just ChatGPT with a prompt. DO pay for Buffer if you need scheduling, team approval workflows, and analytics.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with prompts. Only upgrade to paid tools when you've proven the workflow is valuable and the tool adds real features beyond better UI.

## How to Use This List

### Understanding the Zones

**🟢 Green Zone Tools** - Use freely, output is easy to verify  
Examples: Content drafts, social media posts, email subject lines

**🟡 Yellow Zone Tools** - Use with guardrails, verification takes real work  
Examples: SEO content, ad copy, data analysis

**🔴 Red Zone Tools** - Dangerous without expertise, proceed with caution  
Examples: Customer service chatbots, automated responses to complaints

Read more about the zone framework in [this article](https://maxbraglia.substack.com/p/the-ai-hallucination-debate-is-missing-the-point).

### General Guidelines

1. **Start with prompts** before buying tools
2. **Verify everything** - AI is a draft generator, not a finished product
3. **Build systems** - One-off AI use rarely creates value. Repeatable workflows do.
4. **Match tools to zones** - Don't use AI for tasks you can't verify

---

## Notable Gaps

Marketing functions where good AI tools are still lacking or unreliable:

- **Influencer marketing** - Most tools offer basic discovery but lack sophisticated AI matching or ROI prediction that actually works
- **Podcast marketing** - Beyond basic transcription and clip generation, few tools handle podcast-specific distribution and growth
- **B2B account-based marketing** - AI tools struggle with complex multi-stakeholder attribution
- **Local SEO** - AI tools for managing multi-location businesses remain primitive
- **Brand voice consistency** - Despite marketing claims, most tools still produce inconsistent output requiring significant human editing

---

## Emerging Tools to Watch

Newer tools showing promise but needing more validation:

- **[Peec AI](https://peec.ai)** - Tracks AI visibility metrics (position, sentiment, visibility) across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity with competitive benchmarking—still maturing but addresses growing need. _~€89-199/month._
- **[Rankscale AI](https://rankscale.ai)** - Daily AI visibility tracking with white-label agency reporting; currently in beta with founder-led rapid development. _From $20/month._
- **[Clay](https://clay.com)** - AI-driven centralized prospecting connecting 100+ data sources for GTM workflows; extremely highly rated (4.9/5 on G2) but newer to market.
- **[Distribution AI](https://distribution.ai)** - "Set it and forget it" content repurposing engine that transforms source material into dozens of platform-optimized assets; promising for content teams but needs broader validation.
- **[Writesonic GEO Suite](https://writesonic.com)** - Tracks brand visibility across AI platforms and provides actionable recommendations for improving AI citations; transitioning from pure content generation to AEO.

## Contributing

Found a tool that actually works? Submit a PR with:

- Tool name & link
- What problem it solves (be specific)
- When to use it / when NOT to use it
- Which zone it belongs in (Green/Yellow/Red)

### Contribution Guidelines

**This is a curated list.** Not every submission will be accepted.

Tools must:

- Solve real marketing problems
- Be actively maintained
- Have been tested by you or verified by multiple users
- Not just be ChatGPT with a wrapper (unless the wrapper adds genuine value)

**We will remove:**

- Dead/discontinued tools
- Tools that get worse over time
- Overpriced wrappers that don't add value
- Tools with terrible UX that make AI harder to use

Quality over quantity. Always.
