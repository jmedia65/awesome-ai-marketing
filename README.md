## Prompts & Frameworks (Start Here)

**Philosophy:** Before paying for tools, try these prompts with ChatGPT/Claude. Many "AI marketing tools" are just wrappers around prompts like these.

### Essential Prompt Resources

- [Anthropic's Prompt Library](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/prompt-library/library) - High-quality prompts from the Claude team
- [OpenAI's Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) - Comprehensive guide to effective prompting
- [AI Prompt Engineering for Digital Marketers](https://maxbraglia.substack.com/p/the-complete-prompt-engineering-toolkit) - 10 essential techniques for marketers

### When to Use Prompts vs Tools

**Use raw prompts when:**

- You run this task <10 times per month
- You're comfortable with ChatGPT/Claude interface
- Budget is tight

**Use specialized tools when:**

- You run this task daily
- You need team collaboration features
- The tool adds genuine features beyond prompting (data integrations, workflow automation, etc.)

**Example:** Don't pay for a "social media post generator" that's just ChatGPT with a prompt. DO pay for Buffer if you need scheduling, team approval workflows, and analytics.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with prompts. Only upgrade to paid tools when you've proven the workflow is valuable and the tool adds real features beyond better UI.

## Content Creation

### General Writing Tools

- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)** - The foundation. Start here before trying specialized tools.
- **[Claude](https://claude.ai)** - Better for long-form content and nuanced writing. Excels at maintaining context.
- **[Jasper](https://jasper.ai)** - Expensive but best brand voice memory for teams needing consistency across writers.
- **[Copy.ai](https://copy.ai)** - Good for ad variations and social copy when you need 20 versions fast.

### Specialized Content Tools

- **[Grammarly Business](https://grammarly.com/business)** - Boring but essential. Brand tone consistency across teams.
- **[Notion AI](https://notion.so/product/ai)** - Underrated for internal marketing docs and process documentation.

---

## SEO & Search Optimization

### AI Search Optimization (AEO)

- **[Perplexity Pages](https://perplexity.ai)** - Create content that ranks in AI search engines, not just Google.
- **[The Ultimate Guide to AEO](https://maxbraglia.substack.com)** - How to get ChatGPT to recommend your product (coming soon)

### Traditional SEO with AI

- **[Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com)** - AI features better than building your own keyword research automation.
- **[Clearscope](https://clearscope.io)** - Content optimization that actually moves rankings (expensive, worth it at scale).
- **[MarketMuse](https://marketmuse.com)** - Content strategy and optimization. Alternative to Clearscope.

---

## Social Media Management

- **[Buffer AI Assistant](https://buffer.com)** - Does one thing well: repurposing long content into social posts.
- **[Taplio](https://taplio.com)** - LinkedIn specifically. Content creation + engagement. Actually generates B2B leads.
- **[Expandi](https://expandi.io)** - LinkedIn automation for outreach. Use carefully to avoid being flagged.

---

## Email Marketing

- **[Lavender.ai](https://lavender.ai)** - Sales email optimization. Shows you exactly why your email will fail before you send it.
- **[Instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai)** - Cold email at scale with AI personalization that doesn't sound robotic.

---

## Analytics & Insights

- **[ChatGPT Data Analyst](https://chat.openai.com)** - Upload your GA4/social data, ask questions in plain English. Shockingly effective.
- **[Julius.ai](https://julius.ai)** - Specifically built for data analysis. Better than generic ChatGPT for complex datasets.

---

## Customer Service

- **[Intercom Fin](https://intercom.com/fin)** - Actually reduces support tickets (rare among AI chatbots).
- **[Ada](https://ada.cx)** - Enterprise chatbot that doesn't sound like a chatbot.

---

## Ad Creative & Copy

- **[Copy.ai](https://copy.ai)** - Ad copy variations at scale. Good for Facebook/Google ads.
- **[ChatGPT/Claude with good prompts]** - Often better than specialized ad tools. See [Prompts section](#prompts--frameworks-start-here).

---

## Video & Visual Content

### Visual Content

- **[Midjourney](https://midjourney.com)** - Still the best for marketing imagery despite all the competitors.
- **[Canva AI Features](https://canva.com)** - Magic Design actually works for non-designers. Underrated.

### Video Content

- **[Runway ML](https://runwayml.com)** - Video generation that's actually usable for product demos and ads.
- **[Descript](https://descript.com)** - Video editing via text transcript. Game-changer for content repurposing.
- **[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai)** - Meeting transcription that makes content repurposing trivial.

---

## Workflow Automation

- **[Make.com](https://make.com)** - Better than Zapier for complex AI workflows. Visual builder actually works.
- **[n8n](https://n8n.io)** - Open source automation. Best for developers who want control over AI integrations.

### For Developers Building Custom Tools

- **[Anthropic Claude API](https://anthropic.com/api)** - Direct API access for building custom marketing tools.
- **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com)** - Same as above. Choose based on use case.
- **[Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno)** - Lightweight framework for building AI agents. Better than LangChain for most use cases.

**Note:** Avoid LangChain unless you have specific needs. Most marketing automation doesn't need that complexity.

## How to Use This List

### Understanding the Zones

**🟢 Green Zone Tools** - Use freely, output is easy to verify  
Examples: Content drafts, social media posts, email subject lines

**🟡 Yellow Zone Tools** - Use with guardrails, verification takes real work  
Examples: SEO content, ad copy, data analysis

**🔴 Red Zone Tools** - Dangerous without expertise, proceed with caution  
Examples: Customer service chatbots, automated responses to complaints

Read more about the zone framework in [this article](https://maxbraglia.substack.com/p/the-ai-hallucination-debate-is-missing).

### General Guidelines

1. **Start with prompts** before buying tools
2. **Verify everything** - AI is a draft generator, not a finished product
3. **Build systems** - One-off AI use rarely creates value. Repeatable workflows do.
4. **Match tools to zones** - Don't use AI for tasks you can't verify

## Contributing

Found a tool that actually works? Submit a PR with:

- Tool name & link
- What problem it solves (be specific)
- When to use it / when NOT to use it
- Which zone it belongs in (Green/Yellow/Red)

### Contribution Guidelines

**This is a curated list.** Not every submission will be accepted.

Tools must:

- Solve real marketing problems
- Be actively maintained
- Have been tested by you or verified by multiple users
- Not just be ChatGPT with a wrapper (unless the wrapper adds genuine value)

**We will remove:**

- Dead/discontinued tools
- Tools that get worse over time
- Overpriced wrappers that don't add value
- Tools with terrible UX that make AI harder to use

Quality over quantity. Always.
